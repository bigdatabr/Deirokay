Welcome to Deirokay!

Deirokay (dej…æo'kaj) is a tool for data profiling and data validation.
Deirokay it`s capable of separates document parsing from validation logic,
so that you can create your statements about your data
without worrying whether or not your file has been properly
parsed.

You can use Deirokay for:

Data parsing from files (CSV, parquet, excel, or any other
pandas-compatible format);
Data validation, via Deirokay Statements;
Data profiling, which generates Deirokay Statements automatically
based on an existing file. You may use these statements later against
new documents to make sure the validation still holds for new data.
